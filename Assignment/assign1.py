print('''What is Generative AI?
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas,
including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. AI technologies attempt to mimic human
intelligence in nontraditional computing tasks like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP),
and translation. Generative AI is the next step in artificial intelligence. You can train it to learn
human language, programming languages, art, chemistry, biology, or any complex subject matter.
It reuses training data to solve new problems. For example, it can learn English vocabulary and create
a poem from the words it processes. Your organization can use generative AI for various purposes,
like chatbots, media creation, and product development and design.''')
